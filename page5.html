            Describe the concept of “phishing” in the context of digital security.
      What are some effective strategies to recognize and prevent phishing
      attacks?
        </h2>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Phishing is a cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities
      to steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card details,
      often through fraudulent emails or websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        To prevent phishing, users should verify email senders, check for secure
      website protocols (HTTPS), and avoid clicking suspicious links.
      Anti-phishing software also helps protect against such attacks.

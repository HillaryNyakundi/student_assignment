                  The prototype showcased the homepage of my website. The design
                  included a header section with a title, an image of myself,
                  and a brief introduction paragraph. Below that, there is an
                  unordered list of links to other pages, and a centered footer
                  at the bottom. The layout is clean and simple, with minimal
                  colors to keep the focus on the content.
                </p>

                  I managed to tweak the wireframes of the design, I had chosen
                  illustrations as the images to disguise myself but had
                  challenges blending them with the typograpy and background of
                  the page as the were initially drawn, instead i used a car
                  image, fixed the unordered list, the introductory paragraph
                  fitted nicely, the layout was clean and simple, i experienced
                  the power of CSS in this tranformation.

                  This design serves as a table of contents for my five
                  discussion questions. It has a title and a brief introduction,
                  followed by an ordered list of the five discussion questions
                  with links to their respective pages. The layout is structured
                  to make navigation easy, and the footer includes copyright
                  information.

                  I turned the design around and replicated it page as it
                  appeared in the design. I produced the title, a brief
                  introduction, an ordered list of five discussion questions and
                  links to their respective pages, I include the footer too. I
                  had fun while at it.

                  This design is for the content pages that will discuss the
                  individual topics. Each page will have a consistent layout
                  with a header, content area, and footer. Navigation buttons
                  for moving forward or backward between pages will be added to
                  ensure smooth navigation across the site.

                  On this page, I transformed the prototype into a pleasant
                  design of the content pages, this pages discussed the
                  individual topic, I implemented the header, content area and
                  the footer, the footer contained the references to the
                  research materials. I put navigation links for smooth touring
                  of the site. I had fun and learnt alot while doing this
                  project.

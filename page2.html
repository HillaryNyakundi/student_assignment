          Compare and contrast the physical health risks and behavioral health
          risks associated with prolonged computer use. How can individuals
          mitigate these risks?
        </h2>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Prolonged computer use can cause physical health issues like eye
            strain, back pain, and repetitive strain injuries, while also
            leading to behavioral health problems such as internet addiction and
            social isolation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To mitigate these risks, individuals should take regular breaks, set
            up ergonomic workspaces, and manage screen time mindfully. Physical
            activity and proper posture are also key to preventing health
            problems.
